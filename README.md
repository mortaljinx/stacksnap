# StackSnap

StackSnap is a lightweight compose snapshot tool for Docker Compose stacks.

It automatically:

- Pulls the original compose YAML from Portainer
- Falls back to Docker label reconstruction if a stack isn't in Portainer
- Stores timestamped versions
- Generates unified diffs (only when something changed)
- Rotates old versions
- Runs once — designed for cron or systemd timers

> **Note:** This is a snapshot tool, not a full backup solution. It captures your compose definitions so you have a history of what changed and when.

# 🚀 Quick Start

## Step 1 – Download

**Linux (x86_64):**
```sh
wget https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/stacksnap/releases/latest/download/stacksnap-linux-amd64
chmod +x stacksnap-linux-amd64
sudo mv stacksnap-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/stacksnap
```

**Linux (ARM64 / Raspberry Pi):**
```sh
wget https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/stacksnap/releases/latest/download/stacksnap-linux-arm64
chmod +x stacksnap-linux-arm64
sudo mv stacksnap-linux-arm64 /usr/local/bin/stacksnap
```

---

## Step 2 – Create a Portainer Access Token

In Portainer:

1. Click your profile (top right)
2. Go to **My Account → Access Tokens**
3. Create a new token and copy it (you won't see it again)

> Portainer is optional. If you don't use it, StackSnap will fall back to reconstructing compose files from running container labels.

---

## Step 3 – Run StackSnap

Prefer passing your token via environment variable — it won't appear in `ps` output or shell history:

```sh
export STACKSNAP_PORTAINER_URL=http://localhost:9000
export STACKSNAP_PORTAINER_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN

stacksnap --output /path/to/snapshots
```

Or pass everything inline (fine for testing):

```sh
stacksnap \
  --output /mnt/snapshots/stacks \
  --portainer-url http://localhost:9000 \
  --portainer-token YOUR_TOKEN
```

**All flags:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--output` | `./snapshots` | Where to store snapshots |
| `--keep` | `5` | Versions to keep per stack |
| `--portainer-url` | _(none)_ | Portainer base URL |
| `--portainer-token` | _(none)_ | Portainer API token |

**Environment variable equivalents:**

| Variable | Equivalent flag |
|---|---|
| `STACKSNAP_PORTAINER_URL` | `--portainer-url` |
| `STACKSNAP_PORTAINER_TOKEN` | `--portainer-token` |

# 📁 What It Creates

```
snapshots/
  jellyfin/
    latest.yml            ← Current compose
    2026-02-25_0145.yml   ← Historical version
    2026-02-25_0145.diff  ← What changed (only written if something changed)
    .hash                 ← Change detection (SHA-256 of latest content)
  homeassistant/
    latest.yml
    ...
```

StackSnap only writes a new snapshot if the compose content has actually changed. If nothing changed, it exits cleanly without touching anything.

# 🔁 Run Daily with Cron

```sh
crontab -e
```

```
0 3 * * * STACKSNAP_PORTAINER_URL=http://localhost:9000 STACKSNAP_PORTAINER_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN /usr/local/bin/stacksnap --output /mnt/snapshots/stacks
```

Runs every night at 3 AM.

# 🐳 Docker Version

```sh
docker run --rm \
  --network host \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /mnt/snapshots/stacks:/snapshots \
  -e STACKSNAP_PORTAINER_URL=http://localhost:9000 \
  -e STACKSNAP_PORTAINER_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN \
  <YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/stacksnap:latest \
  --output /snapshots
```

> The container runs as root to ensure it can access your Docker socket and snapshot directory without permission issues on typical self-hosted setups.

# 🔄 Docker Fallback

**For Portainer-managed stacks**, StackSnap fetches the original compose YAML directly from Portainer and saves it verbatim — named volumes, networks, build config, labels, everything is preserved exactly as you wrote it.

**For stacks not in Portainer** (e.g. you ran `docker compose up` manually), StackSnap reconstructs a compose file from the running container's labels and inspect data. This reconstruction captures:

- Image
- Ports
- Volumes (bind mounts only — named volumes are not visible via inspect)
- Environment variables (user-defined only)
- Restart policy

The reconstructed file includes a comment noting it was auto-generated and should be reviewed before use. It is a best-effort snapshot — some settings that aren't reflected in container inspect output (like network aliases or build config) won't be present. For full fidelity, manage your stacks through Portainer.

---

# ⚠️ Security Notes

- **Use environment variables for your token**, not CLI flags. CLI flags are visible in `ps aux`.
- StackSnap makes read-only API calls to Portainer — it never modifies stacks.
- HTTPS connections to Portainer require a valid certificate (self-signed certs will be rejected). Use a local CA or a valid cert — this is the right default for home users.

---

# 🛠 Requirements

- Linux (amd64 or arm64)
- Docker (for the Docker fallback — not required if you only use Portainer)
- Portainer CE (optional but recommended — gives you the original compose YAML)
